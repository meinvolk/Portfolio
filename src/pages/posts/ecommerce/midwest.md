#Midwest Juice

Midwest Juice is a business to business whole sale company that supplies commercial drink dispensers and accessories. When Midwest came to us they made it very clear that they did not want an e-commerce site, rather a site that would allow their business clients to place an order through an online portal. Essentially bypassing all the tedious work of the client calling Midwest to place an order and an employee writing up everything that was requested. The new website would serve the same function with the hassle.

#Design

As you can see in the image with the hideous orange background the old website was dated! The orange juice was distracting and it felt like the content was thrown in there and left to live a long and terrible life. I knew I wanted to give the site a modern look, while at the same time keeping it simple. The site was to mainly serve as a portal for existing business clients to place orders, so there was no need to target an audience that did not exist. Therefore, I kept the site from going to far into a cascade of pages. The company made it very clear that mobile design was a top priority, so I went ahead and created a mock-up for that as well (click the mobile icon to view). They loved the mobile design prototype and gave me the green light to start developing.
