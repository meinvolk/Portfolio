Before Vans came to us he had no website. The main objective of the site was to provide the Google location for each car wash across the area, so that’s what I did. The website has all locations and Google iFrames for easy navigation. The biggest priority for the site was for it to be mobile friendly. Most of the users who would be viewing the site would be on their mobile devices.</p>\n<h2>Design</h2>\n<p>I had a lot of fun designing this site and feel that it is clean and sharp. The white background with hints of blue keep the content clean and specific to the content. The mock up was created in Photoshop and once the design was approved I moved to development.</p>\n<h2>Development</h2>\n<p>The site was developed in WordPress. No theme was used to create this site. I used a blank template and started from scratch. There was no blog or post types, so development of the site was primarily kept to HTML, CSS, and Javascript. By using Advances Custom Fields plugin, I was able to make it so the owner could easily come in and swap the coupon pictures out. The purpose of a CMS is to bring ease of use to the client and that is just what Van’s Car Wash does.</p>",frontmatter:{path:"/vans-carwash",title:"Vans Carwash"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
